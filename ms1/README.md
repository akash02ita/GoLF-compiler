# How to compile / run
To make the project, type
```
make
```
which should produce an executable `golf`.

To run `golf`, type
```
golf <FILE-PATH>
```
and it will lex the contents of the given file.

To remove compiled files
```
make clean
```
which should remove the executable file and the object files as well.
